- [BRK] Significant reorganization of class files. AbstractPage is now
  Controller\AbstractPage.

- [BRK] New SignalInterface and basic Signal manager class. Hooks are now
  executed through the Signal manager instead of directly in exec(). Must
  be passed in AbstractPage constructor.

- [BRK] New Renderer strategy classes, including a default Renderer strategy
  of "None." Rendering now happens through strategies instead of directly in
  render(). Must be passed in AbstractPage constructor.
